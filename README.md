Predicting-Stock-Price-Direction-Using-Support-Vector-Machines

Support Vector Machine is a machine learning technique used in recent studies to forecast stock prices. This study uses daily closing prices for 34 technology stocks to calculate price volatility and momentum for individual stocks and for the overall sector. These are used as parameters to the SVM model. The model attempts to predict whether a stock price sometime in the future will be higher or lower than it is on a given day. We find little predictive ability in the short-run but definite predictive ability in the long-run.

Stock price prediction is one of the most widely studied and challenging problems, attracting researchers from many fields including economics, history, finance, mathematics, and computer science. The volatile nature of the stock market makes it difficult to apply simple time-series or regression techniques. Financial institutions and traders have created various proprietary models to try and beat the market for themselves or their clients, but rarely has anyone achieved consistently higher-than-average returns on investment. Nevertheless, the challenge of stock forecasting is so appealing because an improvement of just a few percentage points can increase profit by millions of dollars for these institutions
